# BruhButton3D
Simple button program for 3ds using LovePotion

this was made as a bit of a test of lovepotion, focusing on graphics, the 3d effect, the touchscreen and sound effects. 3d is a bit wonky but i honestly can't be bothered trying to fine tune it due to how cumbersome testing is.

# To-Do
document the code properly
